# Exercice number 8: Tim Berner Lee webpage   
  
## About ##
Last exercice of the html-css serie. The objective was to create a  
webpage based in a Tim Berner webpage template in order to understand the HTML and CSS. In addition to this  
I also start to work with Responsive Website Design.  

## Tasks ## 

*First Phase: Git*  
* GitHub repository named "starting-web-developpment"  
* Repository clone  

*Second Phase: HTML*  
* index.html file  
* style.css file  
* images folder  

## Timeline ##  
The developement of this exercice took place during the fourth week of the "La Prairie" BeCode training.  

## Work in progress ##  
During the process I struggle mostly with Responsive Website Design (that I start once the webpage was done), so before working straight in to my webpage a took some time to learn the basics and follow some exercices. I also found some dificulties to establish the relationship between the main css and the @Media Queries.
